# Top 3 Programming Language
- Java - Developed by James Gosling in May 23"', 1995
- Scala - Developed by Martin Odersky in Jan 20th, 2004
- Python - Developed by Guido van Rossum in Feb, 1991

#Scala :
Creator : Martin Odersky
Created Date : January 20, 2004

# Highlights:
- The name Scala stands for "scalable language. "
- The language is so named because it was designed to grow with the demands of its users.
  You can apply Scala to a wide range of programming tasks, from writing
  small scripts to building large systems.
- It runs on the standard Java platform and interoperates seamlessly with all Java
libraries.


# Scala Vs Java In nutshell

1. Pure Object Oriented
While Java is not pure Object-Oriented language because of primitive data
types, Scala is completely pure object-oriented language as it does not have
any primitive types.

2. Supports both imperative and functional style.
Let's understand using example.

-Imperative style in Java
public static int findMax(List temperatures)
{
    int highTemperature = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    for (int temperature: temperatures)
        {
        highTemperature = Math.ma(highTemperature, temperature);
    }
        return highTemperature;
}


- Functional style in Scala
 def findMax(temperatures : List[Int]} =
{  temperatures.foldLeft(Integer.MIN_VALUE) {Math.max}
 }



3. Operators are also a function
Scala is an object-oriented language in pure form: every value is an object
and every operation is a method call. For example, when you say 1 + 2 in
Scala, you are actually invoking a method named + defined in class Int.

4. Scala is static typed language

JAVA and Scala both are static typed language.
It means we know its type upfront during the compilation itself and it
doesnot changes dynamically in the runtime.


5. Strong, Inferred

Scala is a strongly type language, which means datatype is checked before
performing operation.
val result="a"+ b; //It checks the datatype of a and b before performing
operations.
Inferred means it is smart enough to understand the resultant datatype.
Scala can be mixed with the java library and you can build an entire
enterprise solution based on Scala.

6. Semicolon, Parenthesis are optional

While writing scala code, it is optional to end the statement with ;
However if 2 different statements are written in same line we must use ; as
a separator
Similarly based on the context dot, and parenthesis can be optional
sl.equals(s2) can be written as s1 equals s2
7. Operator Overloading is allowed

In Java, only + was overloaded, but in Scala you can have your own
operator overloaded.

8. Functional Programming

Java is treated as Object Oriented Programming language, but Scala goes
extra mile.
Scala is a combination of object-oriented and functional programming
concepts in a statically typed language.
As a programmer you have flexibility to write code as per your style.


9. Traits
Traits are like interfaces in Java, but they can also have method
implementations and even fields. Objects are constructed by mixin
composition, which takes the members of a class and adds the members of
a number of traits to them. Unlike a class, a trait can add some new
functionality to an unspecified superclass. This makes traits more
"pluggable" than classes. In particular, it avoids the classical "diamond
inheritance" problems of multiple inheritance, which arise when the same
class is inherited via several different paths.

10. Easy programming to Multithreading

Remember the painful time, when learning multithreading in Java was a
nightmare. With Scala it really does not demand you to concentrate on
locks and synchronization. Scala provides you action based message passing
model that can deal with concurrency. Scala has event-based concurrency
model.

11. Can use Java classes in Scala and vice-versa.

You can use Java classes in your Scala program and hence take the
advantage of any libraries that you wish to include in your programming
requirement. Vice versa is also possible.




Scala Does not support below few things.
1. public Keyword- default is public, unlike no-access in java.
2. static keyword - singleton
3. break keyword - we have break as a function
4. throws keyword- We have @Throws annotations
