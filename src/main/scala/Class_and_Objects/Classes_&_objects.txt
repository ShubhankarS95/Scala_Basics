In Object Oriented Programming language, we basically work with Classes and Objects.
Classes are basically container and prototype of the object.
You can create the class in Scala using class keyword.
It is possible to create a class without any property. It will not have any use in the real time.

Creating a class without any property
scala> class Demo
//defined class Demo

Let's define a class with properties.
scala> class Demo {
    val num1 = 0
    val num2 = 0
    private val num3 = 0
    def add(n: Int) = num1 +num2 + n
// defined class Demo

Note:
- num1, num2, num3 are Instance variable.
- num3 is defined private, that means it is not accessible from outside of the class.

The default access specifier in Scala in public, but in java the default access specifier is default/no-
access.


But in Scala all the Instance variables (where you have not defined the type) should be initialized
with some values even it you don't use it.
Otherwise you will have to define the type, so that scala can auto inject the default value based on
the type.
Otherwise, scala will fail to understand what to inject.

var num1:Int=_ //Works with a warning.
var num1: Int = 0
_ is a placeholder which will be filled up with the default value of numi.

The below code however will not work. Keep it inside the class and try to compile the code.

var num1:Int
class Demo needs to be abstract, since var num1: Int in class Demo is not defined

(Note that variables need to be initialized to be defined)

Note: You cannot use _ concept with the val, As the value is constant and you should assign some
value to it, even if the value is 0. It gives you run time error. No compilation issues.

# _ initialization is deprecated.

Solution:

import scala.compil etime.uninitialized
var numi:int= uninitialized

# Object:

scala> class Demo {
    var num 1 = 0
    var num2 = 0
    private var nums = 0
def add(n: Int) = num1 +num2+ n
}
scala> var d1=new Demo
d1: Demo = Demo@600b0b7
scala> var d2=new Demo()
d2: Demo = Demo@2d35442b   //By default empty constructor would be present.

Note:
d1,d2 are 2 different instances of the Demo class and hence 2 different hashCode
Using d1 object, we can access num1, num2 variables as they are public
but we cannot access num3 as it is private
We called add (40), which added 40+10+20= 70
All the method parameters are by default val in scala and not var, and hence you cannot reassign the
value to it.

# Saving the source code
Consider the below code save as Demo scala

class Demo{
    var name="Suraz"
}
If You compile the code, it will create Demo.class file

>scalac Demo.scala

# Change your class name to Test but save it as Demo.scala
Demo.scala
class Test{
    var name="Suraz"
}

When you compile the above class, It will create Test.class and not Demo.class

# Recap:
Scala files are compiled using filename where as .class files are generated using class name

Can we execute the above classes?

The above class cannot be executed. We need to define a main method to make this program run.
However, if you add main method in the above class. It will not be static and JVM needs public static
main.
Scala does not contain static keyword; hence you cannot really make the main method, static in the
above class.
Solution:
You need to create a separate object where you can define the main method as shown below.

Demo.scala
class Test{
var name="Suraz"
}
object TestClient{
    def main(args: Array[String])={
        val t= new Test
        printin(t.name)
    }
}

Note: Although the file is saved as Demo.scala, It will generate 3 files while compiling
Test.class TestClient.class TestClientS.class

# How do we make the main) static? Do we have a static keyword in scala?
No. We don't have any static keyword in scala.
In order to make the method static you need to change the declaration of class to object.
So, what exactly is an object.
 You can think of object as a class, which has all static methods like utility class in java. Since
  everything is treated as a static method, you don't need to create the object of static class and hence it
  is not allowed in scala.

Change the class to object and rerun the code

object HelloScala{
    def main (args: Array[String])={
    println("Hello Scala")
}
}
cmd>scalac HelloScala.scala
cmd>scala HelloScala
Hello Scala

# What is a Singleton?
Singleton Object:
Scala classes does not have a direct support of static keyword, which means programmer cannot
define static variable and methods.
Instead Scala has something called object which is Singleton. Since object is Singleton, Programmer
cannot create the Object of singleton using new keyword.
A singleton object is declared by using object keyword instead of a class.

Methods and variable declared inside Singleton Object are accessible globally using the object name
just like static variable and methods in Java.

scala > class Demo{
var name="Suraj"
def sayHello()={println(s"Hello ${name}")}
}

defined class Demo
The above declaration is a class declaration. Let's create the Object of Demo class and call the
method.

scala> val d = new Demo()
d: Demo = Demo@78e17a99

scala> d.sayHello() //cannot call using d.sayHello, since while defining the method, you wrote with
Hello Suraj
scala > d.name="Scala"
d.name: String = Scala

scala > d.sayHello()
Hello Scala
